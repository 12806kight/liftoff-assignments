## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I have played Dungeons and Dragons for around 2 years now, and I have greatly enjoyed the game.  When I try to introduce
others to the game, They find it difficult to start the process of creating a character.  The numbers involved with the 
game and the plethora of classes and subclasses you can choose from often scares them away from the game

What I would like to do with this project is to help break down a character into simple parts by introducing a list of 
questions that will help someone choose a class/characters for the start of the game.  I think it would great to have a 
search engine that would look for specific character traits in the description, and the ability to break down characters 
based on certain criteria.
### Features
1. User Login
2. Search Engine for character traits.
3. List of questions to narrow down to certain classes.
4. The ability to look at all characters at once.
### Technologies
Java and possibly Javascript
### What I'll Have to Learn
There is quite a bit of javascript that I will need to learn when trying the project.
